# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Find the number of employees eligible for retirement and the number of open positions

## Initial Analysis
Pewlett-Hackard needs to prepare for the retirement of a large number of employees; 90,399 to be exact. The Production and Development departments stand to lose the greatest number, followed by Sales. In conjunction with that, Senior Engineers and Senior Staff are nearing retirement at high volume. You need to promote from within to establish a leadership group for all of the new hires you will need to make. The suggestion of a mentorship program from the Sales and Development departments is excellent.

### Two Additional Observations
The first thing Pewlett-Hackard needs to do is fix the payroll data. You have tens of thousands of employees making exactly $40,000 a year, which appears to be starting pay. But then there are a number of other salaries in the database going up by $1 at a time. It is nearly impossible that this is accurate data. Who has a salary of $40,001? If Pewlett-Hackard doesn't know how much their current employees are being paid, then they will be in no position to hire new employees.

Also, the employee roster reveals that you have 9 managers, but only 5 are actually assigned to a department. Every department needs a manager, especially with a huge influx of new hires. Assign departments to the remaining 4 managers.

## Mentorship Program
With over 90,000 positions needing to be filled in the near future, Pewlett-Hackard needs to focus on the most immediate needs first. The mentorship program should be tailored to respond to that. There are 1,550 total employees eligible. of the 90,399 retiring employees, 62,172 of them are in leadership positions. That is a huge number to start with in the development of a new program. Since we already know that Production, Development, and Sales will lose the most people, we would be wise to focus on those departments. In addition, we can look at people who are Senior Staff and Senior Engineers, since those are the largest groups of people retiring by title.

In those three departments, there are 4,531 Senior Staff and Engineers. Engineers are primarily in Production and Development, and Staff is primarily in Sales.

Those three departments also have 1,063 employees eligible for mentorship
